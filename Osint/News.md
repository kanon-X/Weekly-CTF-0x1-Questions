## 📰 Description
We've just received a report of The Daily News publishing an article that is causing a lot of concern and fear in the public. Given its wording and theme, we are sure it's fake news generated by the Roomba. However, TDN will not disclose their source. Here's the article — we need you to find the exact number of people that went through Southern Cross Station at the exact time referenced so we can determine if the article is fake. SX Station has released a statement saying that all footage of that night has been deleted, so we can't rely on visuals.
