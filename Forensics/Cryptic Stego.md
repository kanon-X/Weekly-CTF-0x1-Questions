# 🖼️ Encrypted Memories: Visual Forensics Challenge

## 📝 Description
A collection of innocent memories locked behind a forgotten moment. The password? Buried deep—yet never hidden.

> What you see is not always what you get,  
> And what you hear might not be said aloud.  

Sometimes, **pixels whisper**.  
Sometimes, **entropy lies**.  
The key is in the evidence, but the truth is encrypted.

## 🎯 Objective
Your mission is to:
- Analyze the provided image  
- Decrypt the silence  
- Unveil the unseen  
- Expose the secret that was never meant to be found
