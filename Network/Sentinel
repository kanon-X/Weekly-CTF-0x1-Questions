# 🕵️‍♂️ Sentinel : Network Challenge

## 📝 Description
Late last night, a semi-autonomous AI fuzzing agent—internally codenamed **Whisper**—initiated a high-volume entropy cascade against our staging web application, specifically targeting the `/auth`, `/session`, and `/debug` endpoints.

The fuzzer generated thousands of synthetic requests using:
- Randomized headers  
- Malformed cookie chains  
- Speculative replay tokens derived from entropy drift in the session cache  

While most traffic was dismissed as noise, our telemetry backend flagged **one anomalous request**:
- Timestamp offset  
- Header misalignment  
- Payload structure hinting at a latent debug handler being triggered  

This request may have exposed a sensitive artifact—possibly a serialized token or a misconfigured response object.

**File :** [ Network file](Network/network-traffic.pcap.Z.zst)
`SHA1: d8454c16b5e818d23a5981580542153d4dba25e9`
## 🎯 Objective
Your task is to:
- Sift through the provided access logs  
- Isolate the entropy-skewed request  
- Identify any replay tokens, debug artifacts, or session anomalies that stand out from the baseline  
- Reconstruct the missing response through forensic replay or token injection  

⚠️ The flag is **not logged directly**. It is embedded in a response that was triggered but never captured.


## 🧠 Challenge Notes
- The logs are dense  
- Patterns are subtle  
- The fuzzer mimics legitimate traffic  
- Only **one request** holds the key  

**Flag Format :**  xxxx{xxx_xx_xxx_xxxx}
